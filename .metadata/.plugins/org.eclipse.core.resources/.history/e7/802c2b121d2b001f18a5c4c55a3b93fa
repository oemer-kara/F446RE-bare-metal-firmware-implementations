/**
 * @brief Testing UART communication with RealTerm.
 *
 * To verify UART communication:
 * - Open RealTerm and set the baudrate to 115200.
 * - Send characters through RealTerm's terminal.
 *   - If you send '1', the LED should turn on.
 *   - Otherwise, the LED should turn off.
 *
 * This tests the functionality of UART communication with external software.
